title: HP LaserJet 1000 and Windows 10

One day my aunt asked me if I could make her old HP LaserJet 1000 printer work
with Windows 10 Home Edition. I came to her, plugged the printer into her laptop
and saw the famous **USB device not recognized** error. I googled the problem to
only find that support for the driver ended with Windows XP and there's no
drivers for this printer model since Vista. All solutions I've seen used either
Windows 7 32bit with XP compatibility mode (not my case) or a Virtual machine
(VM) with Windows XP shared printer (my guess is it still won't work due to
driver is unavailable, see below). The problem is the laptop runs on a Celeron
processor and has 4GB of memory and Windows 10 is already too slow, so a VM is
not an option.

So the task is: a simple setup for a non-technical person who only needs to
switch on the printer, print some pages and switch it off.

The solution is pretty obvious: a print server. One option is to buy one,
assuming you can find the one you need and make it work. I prefer to keep as
much as possible under my control and, since I've already had success with
[turning my HP LaserJet P1005 into a network printer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-02-07-hpljp1005-as-network-printer %}),
I went with the second option and decided to make a custom print server.

I took the printer home and made it work with Linux without any problems.

**NB**: Windows 10 has a Windows Subsystem for Linux and installing the below
steps might work there. Still, it uses some kind of a VM machine to run Linux
so it isn't an option either.

I settled down to the next setup:
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
* Raspbery Pi 3 case
* Micro USB 5V-2.1A power adapter
* Micro SD card class 10 8GB
* RJ45 Patch Cable
* AC Extension cord with 2+ plugs

**NB**: Some people may argue that spending $70 on the above setup is not
feasible to make a $20 printer work. But I think the device that works for more
than 20 years has earned a second life chance.

Let's go to work...

### Perform the Generic Print Server Setup from [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-02-07-hpljp1005-as-network-printer %}#generic-print-server-setup).

### Setup HP LaserJet 1000

* Plug-in and switch on the printer
* List available firmware files
```
$ sudo getweb
...
    $ ./getweb 1000	# Get HP LJ 1000 firmware file
...
```
* Get HP LaserJet 1000 firmware file
```
$ sudo getweb 1000
```
* Restart the printer
* In the browser go to [**CUPS** admin page](http://printerpi:631/admin)
* Ensure **Allow users to cancel any job (not just their own)** is checked.
* Click **Add Printer**
* Choose **Local Printers**: HP LaserJet 1000 (HP LaserJet 1000)
* Click **Continue**
* Enable **Share This Printer**
* Click **Continue**
* Choose **Model**: HP LaserJet 1000 Foomatic/foo2xqx (recommended) (en)
* Click **Add Printer**
* Click **Set Default Options**
* Click **Maintenance** and then **Print Test Page**
* Store the printer link: http://printerpi:631/printers/HP_LaserJet_1000

That's it! The print server is now accessible via
[IPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol) and [Samba](https://www.samba.org).

### Testing on Windows 10

It's time to test the print server on some Windows 10 machine.

I used a free Windows 10 Enterprise image from
[here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/).

Ensure the print server is reachable:
```
   > ping printerpi

   Pinging printerpi [192.168.100.32] with 32 bytes of data:
   Reply from 192.168.100.32: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=127
   ...
```

### Connect to the printer via [IPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol)

Ensure **Internet Printing Client** feature is enabled.

Run **Turn Windows features on or off** (optionalfeatures.exe).
The **Internet Printing Client** option should be enabled.

![](/assets/images/enable-ipp-client.png)

Adjust as you need. Click **OK**. You may need to restart.

If you prefer command line then launch **PowerShell** as **Administrator** and run:
```
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName Printing-Foundation-Features -Online -NoRestart
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName Printing-Foundation-InternetPrinting-Client -Online -NoRestart
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName FaxServicesClientPackage -Online -NoRestart
> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName Printing-Foundation-LPDPrintService -Online -NoRestart
> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName Printing-Foundation-LPRPortMonitor -Online -NoRestart
```

Adjust the above you need. You may need to restart.

Let's connect to the printer via [IPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol).

Go to **Windows** -> **Settings** -> **Devices** -> **Printers & scanners** -> **Add a printer or scanner**.

If the printer is found you are done. Click on it, print the test page and you can stop reading.

**NB**: I don't know how to make automatic printer discovery work.
It works on some machines and doesn't on others. I've spent huge
amount of time playing with services, firewall, googled about it and no luck.
If you know how to make it work reliably, please share.

If the printer is not found click **The printer that I want isn't listed**.
Choose **Select a shared printer by name** and past the printer link into the field.

![](/assets/images/add-printer-ipp.png)

Click **Next**.

What?! Windows wants the driver, which we definitely don't have.
Fortunately, there's a workaround and this is what, from my point of view,
one of the most valuable points of this article.

![](/assets/images/add-printer-driver.png)

Choose either **MS Publisher Color Printer** or **MS Publisher Imagesetter**.

TODO: Describe what these drivers are. Postscript?
TODO: FIND link where I found it.

Click **OK**.

![](/assets/images/ipp-printer-success.png)

Click **Next**. Click **Print a test page**.

At this point you should be able to print the test page and you can stop reading.

### Connect to the printer via [Samba](https://www.samba.org)

**NB**: Support for Samba is long deprecated. Still it might be a viable option
if your old network printer. See this
[link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows-server/storage/file-server/troubleshoot/detect-enable-and-disable-smbv1-v2-v3)
for more detail.

Ensure **SMB1/CIFS Client** is enabled

Run **Turn Windows features on or off** (optionalfeatures.exe).
The **SMB1/CIFS Client** option should be enabled.

![](/assets/images/enable-smb1-client.png)

Adjust as you need. Click **OK**. You may need to restart.

If you prefer command line then launch **PowerShell** as **Administrator** and run:
```
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName SMB1Protocol -Online -NoRestart
> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName SMB1Protocol-Client -Online -NoRestart
> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName SMB1Protocol-Server -Online -NoRestart
> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName SMB1Protocol-Deprecation -Online -NoRestart
```

Adjust the above you need.

Enable **Samba Unsecure Guest Logons**

On Windows 10 Enterprise and Professional you can run **Local Group Policy Editor** (gpedit.msc)

![](/assets/images/enable-unsecure-logons.png)

On Windows 10 Home you need to edit the Window Registry manually.

Launch **PowerShell** as **Administrator** and run:

```
> Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters" AllowInsecureGuestAuth -Type DWORD -Value 1 -Force
```

Now restart Windows.

Let's connect to the printer via [Samba](https://www.samba.org):

Run **File Explorer** -> **Network**. Press **F5** to refresh.

![](/assets/images/open-printerpi.png)

Double-click on **PRINTERPI**. Double-click on **HP_LasetJet_1000**.

![](/assets/images/open-smb-printer.png)

Windows again wants the driver, which we don't have. But...
Click **OK**.

![](/assets/images/add-printer-driver.png)

Choose either **MS Publisher Color Printer** or **MS Publisher Imagesetter**.
Click **OK**.

Now you've connected to the printer via [Samba](https://www.samba.org) too.

![](/assets/images/installed-printers.png)

Choose **HP_LaserJet_1000 on PRINTERPI** -> **Manage** -> **Print a test page**.

**Congratulations!** The old HP LaserJet 1000 now works with Windows 10 via
[IPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol) and [Samba](https://www.samba.org).
